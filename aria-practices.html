		<p> This version of WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices is published to retire it from the Working Group Note track. The <em>content continues to be updated</em> in a format that is more useful to developers:</p>
		<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/aria/apg/">https://www.w3.org/WAI/aria/apg/</a></p>
		<p>The content continues to evolve in that location. The content is no longer versioned, but continuously updated. Improved code examples are also part of that resource.</p>
